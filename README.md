This is my manually corrected and auto [Ligaturized](https://github.com/ToxicFrog/Ligaturizer), version of @zwaldowski's synthesized italic version of Mozilla's Fira Mono.

The ligatures are lifted from [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) and are therefore not yet italic. Only ASCII characters have been corrected.
